## üìù Code Guidelines

### TypeScript Style
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
// Good
interface PromptExecutionOptions {
  skipUsageLimitCheck: boolean;
  timeoutMs?: number;
}

/**
 * Executes a prompt with the specified options
 * @param prompt - The prompt configuration to execute
 * @param options - Execution options
 * @returns Promise that resolves when execution completes
 */
async function executePrompt(
  prompt: PromptData, 
  options: PromptExecutionOptions
): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### File Organization
- Keep files focused and cohesive
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain consistent imports/exports

### Error Handling
- Use descriptive error messages
- Provide actionable error information
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Log errors appropriately with chalk colors

### Command Line Interface
- Follow existing CLI patterns
- Use consistent color scheme (chalk)
- Provide helpful help text
- Support both short and long options where appropriate

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
Before submitting a PR, test these scenarios:

```bash
# Basic functionality
npm run status
npm run next
npm run help

# Time controls
tsx src/claude-schedule.ts run --stop-at 1pm
tsx src/claude-schedule.ts run --hours 0.1

# Error handling
tsx src/claude-schedule.ts invalid-command
tsx src/claude-schedule.ts run --invalid-option
```

### Configuration Testing
Test with different `prompts.jsonl` configurations:
- Empty file
- Invalid JSON
- Missing required fields
- Different wait times and session paths

**Note**: Copy `prompts/prompts.jsonl.sample` to `prompts/prompts.jsonl` before testing. The actual `prompts.jsonl` file is gitignored to protect personal configurations.
